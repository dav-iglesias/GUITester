Property-based testing tool for graphical user interfaces
=========================================================

Author: David Iglesias Fraga (dav.iglesias AT yahoo DOT es)

"lib/" folder contains third party libraries

Note: "erlang/Visualizing-EUnit-tests" is a git submodule, corresponding to a
third party project. Please, initialize this submodule before proceeding.

System requirements
-------------------

To compile and run the tool, the following software must be installed:

* Java compiler and runtime environment
* Erlang compiler and runtime system
* Apache Ant
* QuviQ's Erlang QuickCheck library. In case of not having it installed, the
compilation procedure will output an error message, but the tool will be anyway
runnable.

Erlang source compilation, configuration and execution
------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile this part, go to "erlang/" folder. In Unix-like systems, run
the shell script "compilaErlang.sh". In other systems, compile the three
applications (the sources are in "src/" subfolders and the binaries must go in
the "ebin/" subfolders).

(Optional) In order to view the graphics, environmental variables "GRAPHVIZ" and
"VIEWER" must be set to the name of an application to convert from .dot to .jpeg
and to view JPEG images, respectively. (See "help" menu).

To launch the Erlang server, run the shell script "lanzaErlang.sh" or the order
within in.

Java source compilation, configuration adn execution
----------------------------------------------------

Use the tool Apache Ant with the "build.xml" file provided. Normally, "ant run"
would meet the requirements.
